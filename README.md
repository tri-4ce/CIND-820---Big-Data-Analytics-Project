# CIND-820---Big-Data-Analytics-Project

I) 
A repository of all iterative code used in the predictive analysis of the Classification of Urinary Biomarkers in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarinoma (PDAC).

II)
The repository contains the developmental code both from the initial univariate/bivariate analysis, data preparation, and exploratory analysis of the Debernardi PDAC dataset in the R language, as well as the continued data preparation, clean-up, feature selection/dimensionality reduction, modeling, as well as the iterative analysis and fitting of the multiple supervised machine learning algorithms heretofor explored in Python.

III)
Overall this project's iterative phases and tentative stages include: 

i) Initial Analysis, 
ii) Exploratory Analysis, 
iii) Dimensionailty Reduction, 
iv) Experimental Design, 
v) Modeling/Evaluation, 
vi) Incremental Improvements, 
vii) Conclusions

IV)
As an ongoing and permanent reference, the Debernardi PDAC dataset used in the development, integration, and execution of this data analysis project can be found at:
